# Varga-Group-Video-Tutorials

YouTube video tutorials for the Varga Group computational nanoscience.

Open the directory that corresponds with what you are looking for. In it, you will find a video playlist as well as a written out step-by-step video summary so that you don't have to rewatch the videos if you are trying to find some piece of information.

If you are new to the group, I would recommend watching Part 0 of the coulomb explosion videos first as it covers how the code works and relevant theory. Then, I would recommend watching the tutorial on the calculation you are trying to perform (e.g. coulomb-explosion)

# Cody Covington video tutorials

Hello all,

In addition to the linux and theory meetings (recordings and materials are here https://vanderbilt.box.com/s/67moopzkyhl5zi0aav0vafwvgu9n97y2) , I wanted to make everyone aware of some other videos that I had recorded in the past.

Most of the submitting jobs in the old video is for the varga cluster, so that will be different from ACES, but there is still some info that would be useful. I made a new video with specifics for parallel jobs on ACES (see the 2nd link below).

An introduction to running ground state jobs and submitting time dependent jobs:

Specifics for submitting jobs on ACES:

Analyzing time dependent jobs looking at the norm, energy, trajectory and density:

Calculations with projectiles both slow and fast:

Also Sam made some other videos, and I think he is making some more. Sam when they are ready, can you share those with everyone? Thanks.
