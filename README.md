# Varga-Group-Video-Tutorials

YouTube video tutorials for the Varga Group computational nanoscience.

Open the directory that corresponds with what you are looking for. In it, you will find a video playlist as well as a written out step-by-step video summary so that you don't have to rewatch the videos if you are trying to find some piece of information.

If you are new to the group, I would recommend watching Part 0 of the coulomb explosion videos first as it covers how the code works and relevant theory. Then, I would recommend watching the tutorial on the calculation you are trying to perform (e.g. coulomb-explosion)

Additionally, here are Cody's tutorial videos:

1st tutorial on compiling, building structures, and solving for the ground state

2nd tutorial on what the RSmax code does (RSmax code is special version of code. Only need to watch if you have access)
